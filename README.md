# Principal-Component-Analysis-Project

To be able to view this project you will need Python, Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda installed. You can click on the hyperlinks to look at a guide on how to install them. Please install the workbook and the dataset and change your directory to the downloaded folder to successfully run the workbook.

My goal with this project is to use PCA as a tool to analyze the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset. Since the dataset is abundant in features, I though it would be a great learning opportunity using PCA.

### Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 569

    :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

    :Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

        The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
        worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
        resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field
        10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius.

                - WDBC-Malignant
                - WDBC-Benign
